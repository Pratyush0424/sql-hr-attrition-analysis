# üßë‚Äçüíº Employee Attrition Analysis Using SQL

This project performs an exploratory analysis on employee HR data to uncover patterns and risk factors related to attrition. Using raw SQL, it identifies how factors like income, satisfaction, promotion, and demographics impact employee turnover.

---

## üìå Objectives

- Understand attrition rate and risk factors across departments and job roles
- Explore how monthly income, satisfaction levels, promotions, and distance affect attrition
- Analyze demographic patterns (gender, marital status) in relation to turnover
- Deliver business recommendations for reducing attrition

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- SQL (Window Functions, CTEs, Aggregations)
- Relational HR dataset (~1,470 employee records)
- GitHub for documentation and version control
